I am a man like no other. A special snow flake that floats in it's own universe. My hobbies are so unique, you wouldn't even be able to relate. Also, my mom told me I was the best baby ever.

I am a lead software engineer for [Elevation Corporate Health](https://www.elevationcorporatehealth.com/). I live in a van and drive it between climbing crags and surf spots. I'm also pretty good at Catan.

If you want to read another little obscure bit of information about me, [check this page out](https://about.me/alondahari).

Don't hesitate to get in touch, for any reason at all (except for marketing or getting me to invest in African gold).
