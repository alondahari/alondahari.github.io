I'm Alon.

I am a man like no other; a special snowflake that floats in its own universe. My thoughts and belief system are so unique, you wouldn't even be able to relate. Also, my mom told me I was the best baby ever.

I write a lot of code, and then I write about writing code. When I'm not writing code, I'm supporting others in writing code or talk about it. After I'm done with all of that, you can usually find me hanging out with my family, rock climbing or playing board games.
